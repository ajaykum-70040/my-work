	Modules	- Elements

	Paradigms
		POP	-	Function/Procedure/Sub-Routine
		OOP	-	Objects

	Single Responsibility:
		Program module should have a single responsibility.

	A program is divided in functions.

	Function: Function is self-contained block of code to carry out a defined
		  task.

	int sum(int a, int b)
	{
		return a + b;
	}


	Function Concept:
		Function Declaration/Prototype
		Function Definition
		Function Call

	YAGNI:	You aren't gonna need it.

	Linear Search O(n)
	Binary Search (Sorted) O(log n)

	int[] binary_search(int a[], int status)
	{
		if(status == 1)
		{
			sort(a);
		}

		

	}

	DS
